# Eat-da-Burgers
A simple web app about burgers, for exploring MVC concepts.

## Technologies
Node.js, MySQL, Express, Handlebars, Bootstrap, jQuery, Heroku.

## Function
The web app stores a list of 'burgers' in a MySQL database.  Each burger has a boolean 'devoured' field.  The views display the 'uneaten' burgers in one column with associated 'Eat it' buttons, and the eaten burgers in the second column.
A 'burger entry' form is also displayed, so the user can insert new burgers into the database.

Heroku handles the backend.
